# Credit
This is a demo on a project I'm workin on related to credit scoring modeling. I serve the model in Streamlit simulating a credit evaluations platform with quick and seamless repsonses for an specific input, based on the credit model performed. The platform leverages a FICO score and the credit historical data (both RGN) to evaluate the probability of default of a potential customer. You can use the tool here and please dont hesitate to reach out if you have any feedback.
